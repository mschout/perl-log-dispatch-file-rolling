    1.00    Initial coding

    1.01    Someone once said "Never feed them after midnight!"---Ok, let's
            append: "Never submit any code after midnight..."

            Now it is working, I also included 4 tests.

    1.02    No code change, just updated Makefile.PL to include correct
            author information and prerequisites.

    1.03    Changed the syntax of the '$' format character because I noticed
            some problems while making Log::Dispatch::File::Alerts. You need
            to change your configuration!

    1.04    Got a bug report where the file handle got closed in
            mid-execution somehow. Added a additional check to re-open it
            instead of writing to a closed handle.

    1.05    Updated packaging for newer standards. No changes to the coding.

    1.06    Fixed a subtle bug that prevented us from locking the logfile
            after a fork if no PID was used in the filename.

            Also disabled forced double opening of the logfile at startup.
            It was in place because I didn't trust Log::Dispatch::File to
            really open the file at the right moment.

            Thanks to Peter Lobsinger for the patch. Please always wrap
            non-standard Test::* modules in eval and make your testfile
            clean up after itself... ;)

    1.07    Fixed rt.cpan.org bug #89001. Seems Log::Dispatch::File changed
            its initialization procedure---and we are inheriting from it.
