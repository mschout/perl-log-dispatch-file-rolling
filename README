======================================

-------
Warning
-------

This module is mostly untested at the moment. Please review the code 
before using it. I'd love if you'd give me feedback on errors or 
success!

--------
Abstract
--------

This module subclasses Log::Dispatch::File for logging to date/time 
stamped files. It uses flock to ensure being safe in a multitasking 
environment. It recognizes a fork() and will reopen the logfile, if 
configured so even with a process specific filename.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires Log::Dispatch::File, included in the Log::Dispatch 
distribution and Log::Log4perl::DateFormat, included in the 
Log::Log4perl distribution.
