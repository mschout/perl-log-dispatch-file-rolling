Log/Dispatch/File/Rolling version 1.09
======================================

--------
Abstract
--------

This module subclasses Log::Dispatch::File for logging to date/time
stamped files. It uses flock to ensure being safe in a multitasking
environment. It recognizes a fork() and will reopen the logfile, if
configured so even with a process specific filename.

------------
